We live here, work here, and clean homes throughout the city — from the established neighborhoods near Tennessee Tech to the newer developments off Interstate Drive and South Willow. Cookeville's mix of mature trees and Tennessee humidity means mold, mildew, and algae are a constant battle for homeowners. We see it on siding, roofs, driveways, and decks all year round.",
    localNote: "Because we're based right here on Webb Ave, Cookeville customers benefit from the shortest response times and no travel surcharges. Most Cookeville jobs can be scheduled within a few days of your quote.",
  },
  baxter: {
    intro: "Baxter is just a short drive from our home base in Cookeville, and we clean homes there regularly. The rural properties and wooded lots around Baxter tend to see heavier mold and algae growth due to shade coverage, which makes regular exterior cleaning even more important for protecting your siding and roof.",
    localNote: "Baxter falls well within our standard service radius, so there's no travel surcharge. We're usually able to schedule Baxter jobs within the same week as your quote.",
  },
  algood: {
    intro: "Algood sits right next to Cookeville, and we serve homeowners there just as frequently as we do in town. Whether you're in one of the established neighborhoods or a newer subdivision, the same Tennessee humidity and shade conditions that affect Cookeville homes affect yours too — and we treat them the same way.",
    localNote: "Algood is practically next door to our base of operations. No travel fees, fast scheduling, and the same quality work we deliver everywhere we go.",
  },
  sparta: {
    intro: "Sparta and the White County area are well within our service range. We make regular trips to Sparta for house washing, pressure washing, window cleaning, and gutter work. The homes around Sparta deal with the same mold, algae, and weathering issues as the rest of the Upper Cumberland, and our soft wash and pressure washing methods handle them effectively.",
    localNote: "Sparta is about 30 minutes from our Cookeville base. We schedule Sparta jobs in clusters when possible to keep things efficient, which means we can usually get to you within a week of your quote.",
  },
  livingston: {
    intro: "We serve homeowners in Livingston and the surrounding Overton County area. Livingston's location in the Upper Cumberland means the same humidity-driven mold and algae problems that affect homes across the region. Our crew makes regular trips to Livingston for all of our exterior cleaning services.",
    localNote: "Livingston is within our 40-mile service radius. We group Livingston jobs together for efficiency and can typically schedule your service within a week.",
